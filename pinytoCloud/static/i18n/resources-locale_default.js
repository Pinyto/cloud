If you are planning to use web services which can not save private keys you will need the first key to access them. This includes this backoffice. However keeping this key activated means that you might be vulnerable to somebody guessing your password. So it might be more secure to only use public keys from the connect app at your devices and deactivate the first key. However you will need this key again if you want to register a new device to your account. You may deactivate the key for some time and then re-activate it with a backoffice app at one of your devices to regain the possibility to register new devices.
