    A Pinyto account consists of a username, a password and
    a pair of asymmetric keys. The keys are used for the
    authentication with a pinyto server which stores the
    data. Username and password are the credentials memorized
    by the user which he can use to access his keys.

    The password is not stored but a hash. If a password is
    supplied the salt is added and the concatenation is hashed.
    The hash of the hash gets hashed until the password was
    hashed for hash_iteration times. The algorithm which is used
    is SHA256. After the last iteration the hash can be compared
    to the stored hash. If they match the password is correct.
